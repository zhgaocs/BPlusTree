# BPlusTree
B+ tree implemented by C++

B+ tree visualization: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html

*If you do not have test data, you can use the script in the `scripts/` directory to generate random numbers to test the B+ tree. When using the script, you need to pass in the file path to save the generated random numbers.*
