# BPlusTree
B+ tree implemented by C++. Note, my implementation is ***single-threaded*** and ***not thread-safe***, as itâ€™s just an exercise for me.

# Tips

*1. If you do not have test data, you can use the script in the `scripts/` directory to generate random numbers to test the B+ tree. When using the script, you need to pass in the file path to save the generated random numbers.*

*2. If you want to verify the correctness of the B+ tree constructed by the program, please visit the following B+ tree visualization online website: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html*
