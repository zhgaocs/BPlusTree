# BPlusTree

B+ tree implemented in C++. Please note that my implementation is ***single-threaded*** and ***not thread-safe***, as it's primarily an educational exercise.

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a B+ tree data structure in C++. B+ trees are widely used in databases and file systems due to their efficiency in range queries and sorting large datasets.

## Features

- **Single-Threaded**: This implementation is designed for single-threaded use. If you plan to use it in a multi-threaded environment, additional synchronization mechanisms may be required.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Use the script in the `scripts/` directory to generate random numbers if you don't have test data. Remember to pass the file path to save the generated random numbers when using the script.
3. Build and run the B+ tree program on your machine to see it in action.

## Verification and Visualization

If you want to verify the correctness of the B+ tree constructed by the program, you can use an online B+ tree visualization tool. Visit the following website for visualization: [B+ Tree Visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html).

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have ideas for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features, feel free to create pull requests.
