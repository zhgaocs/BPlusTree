# BPlusTree
B+ tree implemented by C++. Note, my implementation is ***single-threaded*** and ***not thread-safe***, as itâ€™s just an exercise for me.

*If you do not have test data, you can use the script in the `scripts/` directory to generate random numbers to test the B+ tree. When using the script, you need to pass in the file path to save the generated random numbers.*
